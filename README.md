# Exodus IEEE 2021

### This is a website made using only html, css and vanila js, for IEEE's frontend web-development competition: Exodus.

The prompt for the site was:

With the expanse of the space time continuum, the need for space travel agencies have arisen. Make a website for booking an interplanetary flight. 
Plan a trip for your customers showcasing destinations and flight option along with prices and services offered. 
There should be a final receipt that shows flight details and total price clearly.

Worked on this site along with [Trisha7781] (https://github.com/Trisha7781)
